Temporary repo to report apparent API problems

These two methods of listing the docker contributors do not agree.
Using the "stats" method, I only get 100 contributors, 
and the number of contributions does not match what shows up in the other method.
Some people show up in the `repo/docker/docker/stats/contributors` method 
who do not show up in the longer list produced by `repo/docker/docker/contributors`

So neither list is complete, and the number of contributions is suspect.
